# MultiDimensional Data Structures @ CEID
## Project for MultiDimensional Data Structures Course is part of Computer Engineering & Informatics Department, at University of Patras. 

The aim of the project is to implement multidimensional data structures in three dimensions (k-d trees, quad trees, Range Trees, and R-trees) 
in Python and to experimentally evaluate them using datasets for Range and Similarity Queries on text collections.
